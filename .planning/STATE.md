# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

**Core value:** Users can toggle between container isolation and host-native execution via a single config file
**Current focus:** Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Config Loader) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-07 -- Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (startup integration)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] ~12%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 6.5 min
- Total execution time: 13 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-config-loader | 2/2 | 13 min | 6.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-02 (10 min)
- Trend: 01-02 took longer due to debugging two ESM/pino interaction bugs

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase structure derived from 24 requirements across 5 categories
- [Roadmap]: Security (Phase 5) follows host runner (Phase 4) -- sandbox is mandatory, not optional hardening
- [Roadmap]: Per-group overrides deferred to Phase 8 after security and MCP are solid
- [01-01]: Used z.strictObject() over z.object() to reject unknown keys and catch typos
- [01-01]: Error output via boxed ASCII banners + process.exit(1), not thrown exceptions
- [01-01]: Config singleton is Object.freeze()d for runtime immutability
- [01-01]: Collect-all error strategy (Zod default) so users see all problems at once
- [01-02]: Side-effect import (`import './config-loader.js'`) to prevent esbuild/tsx import elision of unused bindings
- [01-02]: process.stderr.write() for module-level startup messages (pino async transport not ready during ESM evaluation)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (Host Mode Security): sandbox-runtime integration needs deep research before implementation -- flagged by research summary as MEDIUM confidence area
- Phase 7 (MCP Health Checks): Agent SDK mcpServerStatus() API existence unverified -- may need alternative approach
- ESM pattern note: Any future module-level singletons that log at import time must use process.stderr.write, not pino logger (async transport timing issue)
