## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase structure derived from 24 requirements across 5 categories
- [Roadmap]: Security (Phase 5) follows host runner (Phase 4) -- sandbox is mandatory, not optional hardening
- [Roadmap]: Per-group overrides deferred to Phase 8 after security and MCP are solid

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 (Host Mode Security): sandbox-runtime integration needs deep research before implementation -- flagged by research summary as MEDIUM confidence area
- Phase 7 (MCP Health Checks): Agent SDK mcpServerStatus() API existence unverified -- may need alternative approach
